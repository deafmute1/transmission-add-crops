Adds torrents from crops output to transmission, correctly setting download directory based on existing torrent. 

Requires using [my](https://github.com/deafmute1/crops/tree/store-hashes) fork of crops on branch store-hashes.
You can download my crops fork using git: `git clone -b store-hashes https://github.com/deafmute1/crops`
It works just like resu-datcaders fork, but with an extra flag, `--lookup`.
# Install
Things you need: `git` (kinda), `python3` (probably at least python3.8)

1. Download using git
   1. `git clone https://github.com/deafmute1/transmission-add-crops` 
2. Setup python environment
    1. `cd transmission-add-crops && python3 -m venv env`
    2. `. env/bin/activate` (or whatever activate script in /bin you need)
    3. `pip3 install -r -requirements.txt`
3. Setup .env
   1. `cp example.env .env` Modify .env as described in example.env to provide transmission settings.

# Usage 
```
USAGE: python3 tr-add-crops.py [--remove] <path>

path is to a folder of .torrents and a hash-lookup.json file,
   as generated by a crops fork with --lookup option
--remove: removes torrents which fail to verify against existing files,
   instead of leaving them paused
```
